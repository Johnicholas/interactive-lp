Lead in with: CLF *almost* seems well-suited to coding certain types of
programs.

Correspondence: proof search = program execution; *interactive* proof
search = interactive program execution.

Example 1: toggle.

Several things come up...

Example 2: a network of toggles (that toggle anyone adjacent in the graph.)

Example 3: interactive fiction/a game; describe a larger world
dynamic creation of nodes

Proposal: recursive higher-order module system?
